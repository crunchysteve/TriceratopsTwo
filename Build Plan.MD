#Build Plan

Some preliminary mapping out of what I need to get right before proceeding with the more general parts of the frameset, such as making the tilt brackets, building the cross member, etc. There are some precision cuts to be made in the main frame parts, including the ovoid cuts in the square sections to accommodate the steerer head shell.
