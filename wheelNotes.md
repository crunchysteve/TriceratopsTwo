## Wheel build
I'm using Novatec D981SB-12, disc brake, front, 12mm thru-axle hubs with some 28 spoke trailer rims from a kiddie hauler I scrounged from Melbourne's 
wonderful hard rubbish culture and a Meroca 32 hole disk rear 9/10/11 speed hub with a Chinese rim sourced via eBay. The wheel build spec is bog standard 
14G spokes.

### Front Wheels (x2, build opposite hand)
The front wheels are both built to a 2 cross pattern, because of spoke head overlap on the outside flanges, each with the six-hole disk, inboard, 
eg: torwards the middle of the trike, as that's where the ISO mounts will be, on the leaning brackets, adjacent to the axles. According to 
[FreeSpoke](https://kstoerz.com/freespoke/), that's 28x 180mm inside spokes (14 each wheel) and 28x 184mm outside spokes, also 14 to each wheel. 
The disc side flange is 58mm hole circle, the outside is a 46mm hole circle I'll be using these spokes...

### Rear Wheel (1x, it's a tricycle!)
For the rear, it gets more complex, because there's the 15mm disk offset on the left and the 52mm cassette offset on the right. I've also "cold forged" 
and drilled out my donor bike 135mm O.L.D. rear triangle to use the Meroca Boost 142 "standard" hub. (Note to self: read eBay listings better <rolleyes>)
This places no appreciable strain on the frame I'm using, it's a technique used frequently by the late, great Sheldon Brown, and for a 7mm width jump, 
it's only a 3.5mm stretch for the rear tri. The hub still pretty much just drops in.

So, again, turning to FreeSpoke, and entering my hub and rim figures, using 376mmm ERD rim, an 8mm hub offset (centring the tyre on the trike's 
frame-centre), both flanges at 58mm hole circle diameter, brake flange 35mm from the centreline, cassette flange 19mm, we get 16x 180mm spokes on 
the non-drive side and 16x 178mm spokes on the drive side. My supplier doesn't do shorter than 180, so I'll be using 32x 180mm spokes across the board. 
Hey, I can machine 1.5mm off the drive side spokes and there should still be plenty of thread. So that's 32 of these puppies...

### Summary
If you build Triceratops, your wheels and parts will probably be different, so measure everything twice and doublecheck your calculations, so you don't 
have to order, wait and lace twice. I can't recommend [FreeSpoke](https://kstoerz.com/freespoke/) or the Quick Spoke app highly enough, they're awesome. 
If you have one, measure with a vernier or a digital caliper.
