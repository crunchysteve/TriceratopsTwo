OpenScad Plans for a lean steering, recumbent, tadpole trike. Apologies, it's a bit of a hot mess right now, will tidy as I go, but this is what I plan to build will look like. How it works is demonstrated by the GIF below this main image. Some points to note. 
* I'm using a donor bike for the rear triangle, you will need to design your own rear end or use a donor bike and modify this model.
* The Star Trek like "saucer bracket" in front of the steering head is to elevate the crank bracket a little and protect the steering head from collision with a rock, stump or similar obstacle.
* You build and use this machine at your own risk!

This is how it works.
